# Customer Happiness Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer happiness in the logistics and delivery domain based on customer survey responses. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer satisfaction and build a predictive model to classify customers as happy or unhappy.

## Objective

**Primary Goal:** Predict if a customer is happy or not based on their responses to survey questions

**Success Metric:** Achieve 73% accuracy score or above

## Business Context

As a fast-growing startup in the logistics and delivery domain, understanding customer satisfaction is crucial for operational improvement and global expansion. This predictive model enables proactive measures to enhance customer experience by identifying potential dissatisfaction patterns.

## Key Features

The model utilizes customer survey responses across six key dimensions:
- **Order Delivery:** Timeliness of delivery
- **Order Accuracy:** Contents matching expectations
- **Order Completeness:** Ability to order desired items
- **Pricing Satisfaction:** Value for money perception
- **Courier Service:** Satisfaction with delivery personnel
- **App Experience:** Ease of use for ordering platform

Each feature is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where higher values indicate greater satisfaction.

## Methodology

### Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare survey response data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understand patterns and relationships in customer responses
3. **Feature Engineering:** Optimize input features for model performance
4. **Model Training:** Implement and compare multiple classification algorithms
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using accuracy

### Feature Importance Analysis
- Identify which survey questions are most predictive of customer happiness
- Determine the minimal set of features that preserve maximum information
- Provide recommendations for survey optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Classification Models
Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated to find the best performing model for customer happiness prediction.

### Feature Selection Approach
Advanced feature selection techniques were applied to:
- Identify the most important predictive features
- Reduce survey complexity while maintaining model performance
- Provide actionable insights for survey design optimization

### Model Evaluation
- Primary metric: Accuracy (target: â‰¥73%)
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

## Business Impact

This solution enables the organization to:
- **Proactive Customer Management:** Identify at-risk customers before they become dissatisfied
- **Operational Optimization:** Focus improvement efforts on the most impactful service areas
- **Survey Efficiency:** Streamline future surveys by removing less informative questions
- **Strategic Decision Making:** Data-driven insights for service enhancement priorities

## Key Insights

### Feature Importance Rankings
The analysis reveals which aspects of the customer experience are most critical for happiness prediction, enabling targeted operational improvements.

### Survey Optimization Recommendations
Based on feature selection analysis, recommendations are provided for:
- Questions that can be safely removed from future surveys
- Core questions that must be retained for accurate prediction
- Optimal survey length for maximum information with minimal customer burden

## Results Summary

The developed model successfully meets the accuracy requirements while providing valuable insights into customer happiness drivers. The feature importance analysis offers actionable recommendations for both operational improvements and survey optimization.

## Business Applications

1. **Customer Retention:** Early identification of potentially unhappy customers
2. **Service Improvement:** Focus areas for operational enhancement
3. **Survey Design:** Optimized questionnaires for future customer feedback collection
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of satisfaction drivers
